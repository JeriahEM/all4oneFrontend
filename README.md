All for one
we put all our mini challenges onto a website front end using api we made and hosted with azure
peer reviewer Bria
peer review:The design is not exactly correct and the image is looped if the screen is too big, all challenges work except the madlib and restaurant picker. The responsiveness doesnt work for the navabr and you can not go to any other page while in mobile
